# Screaming Liquid Tiger

Simple script to automatically generate valid RSS and Atom feeds from a list of media files in the same folder.

I wrote this because I wanted an easy way to use [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) to listen to my Audiobooks. Podcast players are ideal applications for this, contrary to generic media players. It is also trivial to be adapted to other uses and file types.

## Installation

Just upload the index.php file in a folder on a web server running PHP 5.4 or higher. Edit the configuration variables if needed and upload media files of any kind. For personal podcasting use, these should obviously be audio files but you can use it with any kind of files.
